Some samples to show what my code looks like and how I think about things.

My complete projects are all hosted elsewhere, but this is meant as a public
vignette.  Some of these things are from interviews, or are things that
seemed like a challenge in my every day work.

Anything I wrote that was particularly useful was probably very domain
specific and living in a repo at work.
